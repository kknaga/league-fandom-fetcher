### League of Legends Fandom Data Fetcher

Get the latest data from fandom in JSON format

Run `npm run build` to run the script and get the latest skins data

The fetcher is defined with a single url to fetch and save as JSON. However, the logic for fetching data from fandom can be extended to other URLs as long as they're created in a similar way.

If you see any issues with this script please create an issue or roll your sleeves and create a PR.
